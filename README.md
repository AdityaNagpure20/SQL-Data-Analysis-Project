# RetailSmart-SQL-Data-Analysis
This project is based on RetailSmart Store, where data was imported from CSV files containing customers, sales, marketing, products, and reviews. Using SQL, I performed data extraction, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer key business questions and generate actionable insights. I developed complex SQL queries using JOINs, CTEs, and aggregations to analyze transactional datasets effectively.
